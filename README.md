# adventofcode

My code for [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com). Don't look if you want to participate yourself!

I usually try and learn something new or review some concept or aspect of a language for each day's challenge. Some code will probably be sloppy if I was just feeling like getting the star. Some code may be pretty.

Thanks to my CS 107 professor [Kris Micinski](http://kmicinski.com/) for introducing me to this yearly code challenge.
